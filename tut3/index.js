nodemon is a utility that monitors for changes in files within a Node.js application. It automatically restarts your application when it detects any changes, so you donâ€™t have to manually stop and restart your server during development. It saves a lot of time, especially when working on larger projects!

For example, if you're building an API with Node.js and making changes to your code, nodemon will automatically restart your server every time you save a file, keeping everything in sync.

nodemone default looks for index.js , use command in the terminal ---> nodemon
if you want to use a different file , use nodemon followed by filename (eg. server.js) ---> nodemon server
